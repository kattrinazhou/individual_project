## Progress Made
In the week leading up to the meeting, the following progress was made:

 * Read the literature, especially youtube videos about superreality, and list the pros and cons
 * Came up with an idea for a recipe tour, and conceived the general idea

## Discussion

During the meeting, the following topics were discussed:

* share the new idea 
* Since the idea is suddenly thought up and not mature enough, the feasible points and infeasible points of the idea need to be raised to a meaningful topic, perhaps the same mechanism can be used in other fields
* Mark explained to me in detail the direction he wanted me to go in the beginning, giving some examples of scrolling twitter while walking and where to put the screen so as not to be affected by the vision. 
* **Literature Recommendation**: cake research :
